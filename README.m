## How it Work ?


Here is a simple tutorial video showing how to use our implementation.

## News

:star2: **What's New**

- [2023/5/25] DragGAN is on PyPI, simple install via `pip install draggan`. Also addressed the common CUDA problems https://github.com/Zeqiang-Lai/DragGAN/issues/38  https://github.com/Zeqiang-Lai/DragGAN/issues/12
- [2023/5/25] We now support StyleGAN2-ada with much higher quality and more types of images. Try it by selecting models started with "ada".
- [2023/5/24] Custom Image with GAN inversion is supported, but it is possible that your custom images are distorted  due to the limitation of GAN inversion. Besides, it is also possible the manipulations fail due to the limitation of our implementation.

:star2: **Changelog**

- [ ] Tweak performance.
- [x] Improving installation experience, DragGAN is now on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/draggan).
- [ ] Automatically determining the number of iterations.
- [x] Support StyleGAN2-ada.
- [x] Integrate into [InternGPT](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternGPT)
- [x] Custom Image with GAN inversion.
- [x] Download generated image and generation trajectory.
- [x] Controlling generation process with GUI.
- [x] Automatically download stylegan2 checkpoint.
- [x] Support movable region, multiple handle points.
- [x] Gradio and Colab Demo.

> This project is now a sub-project of [InternGPT](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternGPT) for interactive image editing. Future updates of more cool tools beyond DragGAN would be added in [InternGPT](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternGPT). 






## Running Locally

### With PyPI

üìë [Step by Step Tutorial](https://zeqiang-lai.github.io/blog/en/posts/drag_gan/) | [‰∏≠ÊñáÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ÊïôÁ®ã](https://zeqiang-lai.github.io/blog/posts/ai/drag_gan/)

We recommend to use Conda to install requirements.

```bash
conda create -n draggan python=3.7
conda activate draggan
```

Install PyTorch following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia 
```

Install DragGAN
```bash
pip install draggan
# If you meet ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement draggan (from versions: none), use
pip install draggan -i https://pypi.org/simple/
```

Launch the Gradio demo

```bash
python -m draggan.web
# running on cpu
python -m draggan.web --device cpu
```

### Clone and Install 

Ensure you have a GPU and CUDA installed. We use Python 3.7 for testing, other versions (>= 3.7) of Python should work too, but not tested. We recommend to use [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/download.html) to prepare all the requirements.

For Windows users, you might encounter some issues caused by StyleGAN custom ops, youd could find some solutions from the [issues pannel](https://github.com/Zeqiang-Lai/DragGAN/issues). We are also working on a more friendly package without setup.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zeqiang-Lai/DragGAN.git
cd DragGAN
conda create -n draggan python=3.7
conda activate draggan
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Launch the Gradio demo

```bash
python gradio_app.py
# running on cpu
python gradio_app.py --device cpu
```

> If you have any issue for downloading the checkpoint, you could manually download it from [here](https://huggingface.co/aaronb/StyleGAN2/tree/main) and put it into the folder `checkpoints`.
